    title: "RadicalxChange Fellowship Closing Ceremony",
    description: `April 1st, 1:15 pm to 3:30 pm UTC

Over the past ten weeks, 16 civic-minded fellows from around the globe of various industries and backgrounds worked together collectively with a common thread of strengthening civil society and rethinking public goods.

On April 1st, each fellow will present a short demo of their project sharing their research and findings from their time with the RadicalxChange Foundation team, an army of mentors, and with each other.

Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, and E. Glen Weyl, founder of RadicalxChange Foundation will also discuss the main themes of the fellowship: governance, property, data and competition/antitrust.

Join the fellows, mentors, RadicalxChange team, and our two special guests to celebrate the end of the first RadicalxChange cohort.`,
