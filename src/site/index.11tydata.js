    title: "Navigating Digital Identity in Political Economies",
    description: `July 28th, 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm UTC

Most digital identity systems are centralized (e.g. in big government or technology organizations) or individualistic (e.g. in most blockchain projects). However, being in the world is fundamentally social and intersectional — we are all part of networks. So how might we formalize digital identity in a way that better reflects this complex reality? This panel with leading social technology and computer researchers explores more robust digital identity approaches and potential application areas in political economies.

The starting point for the conversation will be Prof. Bryan Ford's paper Identity and Personhood in Digital Democracy: Evaluating Inclusion, Equality, Security, and Privacy in Pseudonym Parties and Other Proofs of Personhood.

Register to join this spirited panel and ask questions.
