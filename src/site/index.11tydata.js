    title: "RxC Voice: From Election Insights to Action",
    description: `June 30th, 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm UTC

RxC Voice is RadicalxChange Foundation's new governance tool combining liquid democracy, online deliberation, and quadratic voting using QF (Quadratic Funding), Pol.is, and QV (Quadratic Voting).

Our first pilot asked our delegation, "What activities should the RadicalxChange Foundation prioritize in 2021-2022?" The results can be seen here and we look forward to sharing reflections on the process including a Q&A with the community.

We'll go over the curation of the ballot, share interesting insights, look at the next steps for the project, and examine the mechanics of how the vote came to be.

See RxC President Matt Prewitt (who will lead the event) talk about the exciting election outcomes with CEO Jennifer Lyn Morone and Project Developer Alex Randaccio. From delegation to deliberation to the curation of the ballot and then the election, many lessons were gleaned and we're looking forward to sharing how we can make RxC Voice better.`,
