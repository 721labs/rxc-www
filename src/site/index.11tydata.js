## Speakers

Jennifer Morone (@jlmorone) is an artist and CEO of RadicalxChange Foundation. As an artist, she makes work that seeks to disrupt the narratives that humans create – such as corporations and nation states, and has been dealing with the problematic of the position of the individual in the contemporary world of work for many years. In 2014 she registered herself as a corporation – Jennifer Lyn Morone™ Inc, of which she is the director, the shareholder, and the basic product, in order to try to provoke the ruling economic and legal system from within. Since 2019 she has been working on The Scheme of Things, a co-creative process that brings to life imaginations of what a desirable post-work world might look like through various media.

Matthew Prewitt is RadicalxChange Foundation’s president, a writer and blockchain industry advisor, and a former plaintiff’s side antitrust and consumer class action litigator and federal law clerk.

Paula Berman is a member of the RadicalxChange Foundation core team. Prior to that, she was a member of the RadicalxChange Fellowship 2021 Cohort. Paula has a wealth of experience studying the impact of blockchain technology on local and global governance, as well as implementing participatory technologies and researching decentralized identity protocols.`,

    title: "Announcing the Next Annual RxC Conference December 2021",
    bodyText: `Democracy is in crisis at a critical moment when we face seemingly insurmountable challenges from growing economic disparity, climate change, and a global pandemic. Despite increased and active involvement of citizens in the democratic process, our governing systems, stifled with deepening polarization, are halting progress.

Fortunately, pockets of innovators working inside and outside of states are developing new tools and methods for making group decisions, governing shared resources, and building tomorrow’s democratic infrastructure. This culture of “civic technology”, partly inspired by the activists of g0v in Taiwan and drawing energy from many communities and disciplines, is at the heart of the RadicalxChange movement.

Whether you identify as forward-thinking technologists, social scientists, artists, activists, community leaders, entrepreneurs, or everyday people dedicated to this shared mission, please join us for the 3rd Annual RadicalxChange unConference to connect with others and co-create a radically egalitarian and participatory future.`,
