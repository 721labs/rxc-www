    title: "RadicalxChange Voice: An Introduction",
    description: `March 25th, 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm UTC

RadicalxChange Voice is a new governance tool and experiment to bring in the RxC community to guide RxC Foundation's work. Hopefully, if the experiment turns out well, we can help other communities adopt it to enable a broader range of democratic participation. It also features some new thinking about QF, Pol.is, and QV. As we get ready to try it out, the Foundation's team introduces you to RxC Voice's end-to-end democratic process and explains the thinking behind it. Most importantly, it is your opportunity to ask us anything about it.
