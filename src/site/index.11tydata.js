In addition to the in-person and online events of the 3rd Annual RadicalxChange unConference in December 2021, RadicalxChange put together RxC TV, a unique 3-part program that was streamed live the day before each Open Space unConference and thematically related to the succeeding event, to inspire and learn.

We have since assembled a fourth episode of never before seen bonus content. RadicalxChange presents: RxC TV - Day 4.`,

    bodyText: `Democracy is in crisis at a critical moment when we face seemingly insurmountable challenges from growing economic disparity, climate change, and a global pandemic. Despite increased and active involvement of citizens in the democratic process, our governing systems, stifled with deepening polarization, are halting progress.

Fortunately, pockets of innovators working inside and outside of states are developing new tools and methods for making group decisions, governing shared resources, and building tomorrow’s democratic infrastructure. This culture of “civic technology”, partly inspired by the activists of g0v in Taiwan and drawing energy from many communities and disciplines, is at the heart of the RadicalxChange movement.`,
