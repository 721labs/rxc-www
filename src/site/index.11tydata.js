    title: "Governance and Technological Progress",
    description: `May 13th, 3:30 pm to 5:00 pm UTC

The narrative of technological progress has arguably overlooked progress in governance. Why is that? What are the risks of exponential technology? Why is governance important and can it get better, too? Must it always be catching up to technology? What might democracy at scale look like?

Please join us for this conversation examining technological progress in governance and whether its narrative has truly been overlooked with Deepti Doshi, Nathan Schneider, and Divya Siddarth, moderated by RxC President Matt Prewitt.

Register to join this thought-provoking panel and get involved in the conversation by asking questions on Slido, tweeting us @radxchange (#RxCLiveTalk), and sharing this event.

    title: "Announcing the RxC Warsaw Conference & Freedom Games",
    bodyText: `With Europe at war, the world has profoundly changed since our conferences in Taipei and Denver last December. More than ever, we must step up together and embrace the power of diverse cooperation.

This October, the RxC community will safely gather in Łódź, Poland for the [2022 Freedom Games (Oct 14-16)](https://igrzyskawolnosci.pl/en/), and subsequently in neighboring Warsaw, Poland, for a day of solidarity, inspiration, and co-creation.

Together in Poland, we will learn of pioneering digital democracy practices in Ukraine, Estonia, and across Eastern Europe. We will experience works of art as windows to connection, and examine European institutions through the frame of pluralistic governance. We will uplift the work of activists, social fabric weavers, and critical voices. We will consider European cases for community currencies, data cooperatives, decentralized identity systems, communication tools, and other pro-social digital infrastructures and civic technologies.

We invite you to join us at the [2022 Freedom Games in Łódź, Poland, & Online (Oct 14-16)](https://igrzyskawolnosci.pl/en/), where RadicalxChange is a partner, and at our conference “RadicalxChange Warsaw: Europe and The Futures of Pluralism,” which will be staged with the support of [Wildland](https://wildland.io). The Warsaw event will take place on Tuesday, the 18th of October 2022, at the [Mała Warszawa](https://goo.gl/maps/J3r6PqmAJTiAcDmZ6) conference center.`,
