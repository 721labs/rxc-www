    description: `October 18th, 9:00am to 6:00 pm CEST

With Europe at war, the world has profoundly changed since our conferences in Taipei and Denver last December. More than ever, we must step up together and embrace the power of diverse cooperation.

This October, the RxC community will gather in-person (& Online) in Łódź, Poland (Oct 15-16) and in Warsaw, Poland (Oct 18).

Here we invite you to our conference in Warsaw: “RadicalxChange Warsaw: Europe and The Futures of Pluralism.” The event will take place on Tuesday, October 18th, 2022 at the Mała Warszawa conference center, with the support of [Wildland](https://wildland.io).

Together we will learn of pioneering digital democracy practices in Ukraine, Estonia, and across Eastern Europe. We will experience works of art as windows to connection, and examine European institutions through the frame of pluralistic governance. We will uplift the work of activists, social fabric weavers, and critical voices. And we will consider European cases for community currencies, data cooperatives, decentralized identity systems, communication tools, and other pro-social digital infrastructures and civic technologies.`,
