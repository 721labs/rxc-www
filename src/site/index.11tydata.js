    title: "Exploring Social Technologies for Democracy",
    description: `September 30th, 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm UTC

We see democracy as ideally a process of co-creating the conditions of our shared lives, solving our collective problems, and learning about life from and with each other. The less force and the more creativity, aliveness, and intelligence we can bring to this process, the better. This requires a lot of communication and conversation to share information, ideas, experiences, needs, values, energy and so much more - in ways that actually work.

Many different approaches to doing this sharing and talking have been created. When such ways are formalized as methods that can be applied and taught, we call them “technologies”. Most of the social technologies for democracy we work with are grounded in conversation - discussion, dialogue, deliberation, choice-creating, negotiation, collective visioning, and various forms of council, assembly, conference, and so on. There are different dynamics and nuances among them, and there are experts trained to facilitate the theory and/or practice.

Democratic technologies, thought of and used in this way, can be applied in creative new ways that enable people to become more engaged with each other, with better results and less wasted, counter-productive energy, thus moving towards more successful, enjoyable self-governance. They operate at a variety of scales from small groups, organizations, and networks to whole societies.

Please join us for this conversation exploring social technologies and their role in fostering democracy with Kaliya Young, Heidi Saul, and Tom Atlee, moderated by RxC CEO Jennifer Morone.

Tom Atlee (@tomatlee) is co-founder of the nonprofit Co-Intelligence Institute in Eugene, Oregon. His book titles give a good sense of his life’s work - The Tao of Democracy, Empowering Public Wisdom, Participatory Sustainability, and Reflections on Evolutionary Activism. His beautifully illustrated Wise Democracy Pattern Language offers an encyclopedia of democratic innovations and of approaches to generating collective wisdom. It even comes with a card set to explore ideas, challenges and possibilities through the wise democracy lens. His blog - Random Communications from an Evolutionary Edge - explores an even wider range of topics in provocative ways. (He really likes words like “explore” and “possibility".) He writes, philosophizes, networks, and Zooms into fascinating conversations from his room in an urban coop with 8 housemates and from the rural dome home of his sweetheart and her loving pit bull. Tom is a true public intellectual having spent 32 years researching and writing about co-intelligence with no formal institutional support beyond his small nonprofit. He is supported by the people on his mailing list which you can join by emailing him at cii@igc.org (subject: SUBSCRIBE).
