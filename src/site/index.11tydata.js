Many people in the RadicalxChange community and data science arena agree that we need collective bargaining power to make digital networks genuinely democratic and transparent. In this spirit, the speakers of this panel are on the mission of uniting the world's data producers. They are true leaders in this space and share their experiences from their everyday work for data dignity.

Enoch helped start The Data Dividend Project to help consumers collectively exercise their data rights and to collectively bargain with tech companies.
