Welcome to the 3rd Annual RadicalxChange unConference.

In addition to the in-person and online unConference events, RadicalxChange is putting together RxC TV, a unique and never before seen 3-part program that will be streamed LIVE the day before each Open Space unConference and thematically related to the succeeding event, to inspire and learn.

Broadcasts will be on December 3rd, 9th, and 16th corresponding to their respective time zones.`,

    bodyText: `Democracy is in crisis at a critical moment when we face seemingly insurmountable challenges from growing economic disparity, climate change, and a global pandemic. Despite increased and active involvement of citizens in the democratic process, our governing systems, stifled with deepening polarization, are halting progress.

Fortunately, pockets of innovators working inside and outside of states are developing new tools and methods for making group decisions, governing shared resources, and building tomorrow’s democratic infrastructure. This culture of “civic technology”, partly inspired by the activists of g0v in Taiwan and drawing energy from many communities and disciplines, is at the heart of the RadicalxChange movement.`,
