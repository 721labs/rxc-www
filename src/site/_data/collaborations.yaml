    Proof of Humanity is an identity registry on Ethereum, aiming to tackle the “double human” problem: a type of fraud in which one person registers into a domain multiple times, pretending to be various distinct, independent entities. Similarly to the “double spend” problem, solving this challenge unlocks a world of unprecedented possibilities. It enables the creation of decentralized democracies (without the need for a centralized membership authenticator to ensure each person can only vote once), and Universal Basic Income cryptocurrencies (without a centralized membership authenticator to ensure each recipient can only receive their UBI once).
