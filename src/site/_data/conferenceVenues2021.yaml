    RxC 2021 is a maximally participatory and attendee-led Open Space unConference. It has no keynotes or panels, so it’s about learning and getting stuff done!

    The agenda will be created live by attendees present at the opening circle.

    Through dozens of sessions you will have plenty of chances to present your ideas, ask questions, engage in challenging dialog, and make new professional connections. The Open Space unConference format is perfect for a rapidly moving field where the organizing team cannot predetermine what needs to be discussed.

    Big ideas, concrete partnerships, and meaningful relationships emerge from Open Space events at a higher rate than conventional conferences. We are excited about Open Space as a path toward solidifying and growing communities of common purpose.

    **活動形式**

    RxC 2021 是一場完全以參與者為中心的開放空間年會，活動中沒有一般的主題論壇講座或對談，一切都跟學習和搞定事情有關。

    年會的議程將會直接在活動現場圍圈圈討論，由參與者們自己設定主題。

    在活動中，你將有無數機會展現你的想法、提問、展開充滿挑戰的對話，以及建立更多新的專業網絡。開放空間會議的活動形式特別適合發展迅速的領域，主辦單位並不會事前決定好當天活動會討論哪些議題。

    跟傳統會議相比，在開放空間會議中能夠激發出更多有趣的想法、找到直接的合作夥伴，更快速地建立有意義的關係。我們非常期待開放空間會議能夠凝聚大家，形成一個擁有共同目標的社群。
