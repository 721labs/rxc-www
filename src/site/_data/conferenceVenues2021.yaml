    RxC 2021 is a maximally participatory and attendee-led Open Space unConference. It has no keynotes or panels, so it’s about learning and getting stuff done!

    The agenda will be created live by attendees present at the opening circle.

    Through dozens of sessions you will have plenty of chances to present your ideas, ask questions, engage in challenging dialog, and make new professional connections. The Open Space unConference format is perfect for a rapidly moving field where the organizing team cannot predetermine what needs to be discussed.

    Big ideas, concrete partnerships, and meaningful relationships emerge from Open Space events at a higher rate than conventional conferences. We are excited about Open Space as a path toward solidifying and growing communities of common purpose.
