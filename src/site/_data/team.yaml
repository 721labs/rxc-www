    Jo Guldi is a scholar of Britain's history and its empire who is especially involved in questions of state expansion, the contestation of property under capitalism, and how state and property concepts are recorded in the built environment's landscape. These themes informed her first book, Roads to Power, which examined Britain's interkingdom highway and its users from 1740 to 1848. They also inform her current research into rent disputes and land reform for my next monograph, The Long Land War, which profiles three moments in the history of property: the Irish Land Court of 1881 and its invention of rent control, the ideology of "squatting" in post-1940 Britain, and the creation of the "participatory map" for contesting legal boundaries in Britain and India in the 1970s and 80s.
