  description: |
    Technology companies wield highly concentrated power over the way peoples’ data is used, and make enormous profits from it. They can do this because we “bargain” for Big Tech services as if we were all isolated individuals, with “personal” datasets. In fact, the data we produce is always deeply social.  Sharing it affects our friends, families, and communities as much as it affects us.

    People should be able to exert democratic collective bargaining power over their data, in order to make joint decisions controlling its use, and negotiate appropriate compensation.

  description: |
    Plural Voting (also known as Quadratic Voting or QV) is a redesigned voting method reflecting the intensity of people's preferences in collective decisions. It greatly mitigates tyranny-of-the-majority and factional control problems.

    Voters receive budgets of “voice credits,” which they allocate to different questions on the ballot to signal the intensity of their conviction. Their voice credits convert to “counted votes” according to their square root. So if you put one voice credit on an issue, that is one vote; four credits are two votes; nine credits are three votes, and so on.

  slug: plural-funding
  description: |
    Plural Funding (also known as Quadratic Funding or QF) is a more democratic and scalable form of matching funding for public goods, i.e. any projects valuable to large groups of people and accessible to the general public.

    “Matching funding” is a model of funding public goods where a fund from governments or philanthropic institutions matches individual contributions to a project. Plural Funding optimizes matching funds by prioritizing projects based on the number of people who contributed. This way, funds meant to benefit the public go towards projects that _really benefit a broad public_, instead of things that only have a few wealthy backers. In Plural Funding, [total funding] for a proposal is [the square root of each contribution to it → summed up, then squared.] Plural Funding strongly encourages people to make contributions, no matter how small, and ensures a democratic allocation of funds meant to benefit the public.

  description: |
    Plural ownership (also known as partial common ownership) is a new way of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.

    In plural ownership ownership systems (also known under the acronyms COST and SALSA), assets belong to no one and everyone. An asset’s current possessor, must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend.  If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.

For example, markets could be made fairer if there were more stakeholder representation on boards; more thoughtful limits on mergers and acquisitions; and fewer investors exerting control over multiple companies within an industry.

- title: Plural Identity
  slug: plural-identity
  description: |
    Whereas most existing identity concepts are either centralized or individualistic, Plural Identity (XID) solutions embody human identities' social, and multi-dimensional characteristics. XID makes use of three central primitives:

    1. Each participant has a digital journal listing all their identifying information. (Only that individual has access to the complete set of data in that store.)
    2. For each input X in their digital journal, each participant also stores the set of other participants who also keep copies of X.
    3. Each participant stores a degree of credit. They are willing to offer other participants credit as “social collateral” to give their identity statements credibility.

        ‪Equality Protocol is a probabilistic score for human identity on Ethereum. The score results from a subjective (deliberative process) and an objective (Gini coefficients) input. Certain scores give you the right to participate in e.g. universal basic incomes or elections.
