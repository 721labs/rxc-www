  Interdependent, Cooperative and Diverse Complexity: Building a Plurality Agenda for Democracy & Web3

  RadicalxChange Foundation and Fundaci√≥n Karisma invite you to join us in learning, getting inspired and co-creating with us at our pop-up event at Schelling Point ‚Äî Bogot√°!
bodyText: |
  Since 2018, our communities have advanced a series of ground-breaking primitives ‚Äî many of which have been widely adopted within the Ethereum ecosystem. Now, we are centering the narrative on a broader conceptual framing that connects those primitives into a cohesive vision: **Plurality** üññ

  Plurality is both a democratic agenda for the future of technology and governance, and a social philosophy based on the principle of *fostering cooperation across diversity*. Throughout the past few years, pluralistic features have been instantiated on multiple Ethereum-based protocols, ranging from governance, identity, payments, reputation and public goods funding solutions; and also by forward looking governments, and other innovative digital platforms.

  At the Plurality tent @ Schelling Point ‚Äî Bogot√°, we'd like to highlight these achievements, and point the way forward to a path that can support even more complexity, diversity and structure, through novel and recombinant ecosystems at Web3 and other infrastructures of power, such as governments and grassroots movements.
topicsBlurb: |
  All are welcome to join, and we‚Äôll be covering topics like:

  - Examining Web3 platforms through the frame of pluralistic, decentralized governance models.
  - Paving the blockchain/web3 roads to increased user agency, interoperability, political participation, and funding the common good.
  - Uplifting the work of activists, social fabric weavers, and critical voices.
  - Experiencing works of art as windows to connection and means of change.
  - Exploring use cases for community currencies, data coops, DeID systems, SBTs, and other pro-social technologies
scheduleBlurb: |
  Our day will go from 10 AM to 5 PM COT.

  MORE DETAILS COMING SOON.
