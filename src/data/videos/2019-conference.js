      "March 24, 13:00 - 14:00\nBreakout Session\nContent level: Breakout\nTolstoy’s late-career book, “What is Art” is an underappreciated classic of art criticism. It lucidly maps connections between art, class, and economics, and suggest a vital role for art in bringing about a more just society. Perhaps unsurprisingly, during this period of his life, Tolstoy was also an ardent enthusiast of the economic theories of Henry George, and was articulating out a vision of nonviolence that inspired twentieth-century leaders such as Ghandi and MLK. It is time to revitalize his legacy.",
