    title: "Governance & Technological Progress",
    speakers: "Deepti Doshi, Nathan Schneider, Divya Siddarth, Matt Prewitt",
    description: `The narrative of technological progress has arguably overlooked progress in governance. Why is that? What are the risks of exponential technology? Why is governance important and can it get better, too? Must it always be catching up to technology? What might democracy at scale look like?

    Please join us for this conversation examining technological progress in governance and whether its narrative has truly been overlooked with Deepti Doshi, Nathan Schneider, and Divya Siddarth, moderated by RxC President Matt Prewitt.
