## Topic
**Briefly summarize the topic that you would like the new wiki page to cover**

Ex: I heard that the residents of Whoville used pol.is and Quadratic Voting to deliberate on a coordinated response to the threat posed to their town by the Wickersham Brothers and their penchant for boiling things they don't understand. It would be great if someone from Whoville could document this experience in a wiki page so that others can learn from it!

## Title
**Propose a title**

Ex: QV in Whoville

## Outline
**Sketch an outline of the proposed wiki page**

Ex:
- Intro
- Description of the use case
    - The threat posed by the Wickersham Brothers
    - Time constraints
    - Scale of the decision & other logistical constraints
- How QV was chosen / other approaches considered
- Implementation details
    - Process design details
    - Troubleshooting / adjustments made during the process
    - Results of process
- Reflection on the process and its successes or failures

## Related content
**List any existing wiki page(s) that relate to this topic. Feel free to include notes on how they are related.**
*Note: you can create links like this: [title](url). See the example below.*

Ex:
- QV in Whoville describes a use case of [Quadratic Voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/wiki/quadratic-voting/).
- [QV in Colorado](https://www.radicalxchange.org/wiki/colorado-qv/) is an existing page that follows a similar format to what I'm proposing here.

## Scope
**Should a new wiki page be created for this content? Or should it be added to an existing wiki page? Feel free to explain your reasoning if you think it is necessary.**

Ex: We should create a new page for QV in Whoville.

OR

Ex: Since we already have a page for QV in Whoville, documentation of the most recent Whoville events can be added to the existing page under the section title "Whoville QV 2023".

## Additional context
**Add any other context or thoughts that you think might be helpful.**
